### [Day 8] Special by John Hammond Santa's Bag of Toys

WIndows Powershell log analysis 

While you do not have to use these commands for this task, these will turn on PowerShell Transcription Logging for a local host if entered in an Administrator command prompt:
```powershell
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription /v EnableTranscripting /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription /v OutputDirectory /t REG_SZ /d C:/ /f
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription /v EnableInvocationHeader /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f
```

The Windows Registry is a large database of operating system settings and configurations. It is organized by "hives", with each hive containing "keys" and their corresponding "values." PowerShell Transcription Logging can be enabled in this way "per-user" via the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` registry hive, or across the entire host via the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` registry hive.
